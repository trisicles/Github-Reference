<h1>Hello! Welcome to your GitHub Resource Guide.</h1>
<p>This will be a step-by-step resource on how to make and publish your own website using GitHub so you don't forget.</p>
<h2>Step One; Make a new repository.</h2>
<img src="Assets/1.png" alt="Step One Image">
<p>In the top right corner, next to your profile dropdown, there will be a little '+' sign. Clicking on this will give us an option to make a new repository. Go ahead and click on "New Repository"</p>
<img src="Assets/2.png" alt="Step Two Image">
<p>Here is the main page for setting up a new repository.</p>
<p>Name the file in the box given. Make sure to check the 'Read Me' box, then click 'Make Repository'.</p>
<h2>Step Two; Adding files.</h2>
<img src="Assets/3.png" alt="Step Three Image">
<p>This is where you will set up files. To add files, click the 'Upload Files' button.</p>
<img src="Assets/4.png" alt="Step Four Image">
<p>Open your files. To do this correctly, make sure you see the "Assets" folder, the "CSS folder", and the index.html file.</p>
<img src="Assets/5.png" alt="Step Five Image">
<p>Highlight all three icons and drag them into the GitHub window.</p>
<img src="Assets/6.png" alt="Step Six Image">
<p>Tada! You just uploaded files into GitHub.</p>
<h2>Step Three; Publishing your GitHub.</h2>
<img src="Assets/7.png" alt="Step Seven Image">
<p>Here is you can see all of your uploaded files in one space. This is so you know you didn't completely ruin your project.</p>
<p>Now that you have confirmation, it's time to upload your GitHub. Click the settings button.</p>
<img src="Assets/8.png" alt="Step Eight Image">
<p>You're here! Congrats.</p>
<img src="Assets/9.png" alt="Step Nine Image">
<p>You're going to scroll down until you see the title "GitHub Pages". Click the first drop down menu and set it to "Master Branch".</p>
<img src="Assets/10.png" alt="Step Ten Image">
<p>If you see the link being blue, your page is not ready. If you click on it, you will get this:</p>
<img src="Assets/11.png" alt="Step Eleven Image">
<p>A big fat error code. Amazing.</p>
<img src="Assets/12.png" alt="Step Twelve Image">
<p>The link is green! This means your page is ready. Click that sucker.</p>
<img src="Assets/13.png" alt="Step Thirteen Image">
<p>Here is your webpage! Pay no mind that the url is different- GitHub wasn't working and I was getting impatient.</p>
<h2>Enjoy your new site! Don't do some weird stuff that'll have the FBI on you! Safe journeys!</h2>
